# Risk-assessment
<h1> Description </h1>
I've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, we are creating a risk register to help us focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

The supervisor asked me to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register.
<h1>Project process</h1>
 For each risk, first I'll determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then,I'll determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, I'll  calculate a score for the severity of that risk. I'll then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
 First I had to do some research about the encryption algorithms and the location properties of the bank so after the research I found that :
The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's
data 100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes
2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a
professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial
regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available
each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.
after that it was time to do the rist register so this is the results after conducting the report.
